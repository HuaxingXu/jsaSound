Scenario - sound model design. 

The "sound designer" is the pro who creates potentially rich and complicated sound generators/behavior using Webauido and other tools for DSP etc. 
Distinguised from the "sound user" who are game, application, and web developers, (probably scriptors andprogrammers, but not sound specialists).

Sound models described at the high-level have SFX library like names (steam train, footsteps (high heels), footsteps (boots in snow), thunderstorm, hydrolic lift, chain saw, laughing)
They expose and API that is 
	a) one aspect and result of the sound model design process and specificiation,
	b) has a standard format (e.g. snd.setParamter("footsteps-rate", 3.2)) . That is, the paramter can have a sound model-specific affect on the behavior of  the model, but a standardized way of being called.

What is needed in the Usage Scenario?
	
Scheduling
Would like to get callbacks to fill "next audio" buffer" a few ms ahead of when it will play. 
Would like to set callbacks specified in playtime in a queue that get fired at the exact (computed) play-time specified. 

Ask a node if it is connected to anything or if anything is connected to it.

Have exactly the same functionality for jsavascript nodes as any other node.
