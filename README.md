jsaSound
========

jsaSound is an interactive sound library that uses the [Web Audio API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/) to provide playable sound models. The code is entirely modular, and allows asynchronous loading of different modules.
jsaSound is built using the RequireJS JavaScript loader. To use RequireJS, follow the instructions at http://requirejs.org/docs/start.html
Simply include the path to the "jsaSound" directory in your require config, and you can play with the sounds, as shown in `index.html`
