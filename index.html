		<h1> jsaSound for Interactive Sound Modeling</h1>
		jsaSound helps interactive sound designers to provide sound users (game, web, application developers) with models that have a simple and consistent API exposing exactly the interaction the designer intends. <br>
		<br>
		<b> The Sound Model API: </b>
		<div id="API" >
			<div id="APItext">
				play()<br>
				release()<br>
				stop()<br>
				<br>
				setParam([name, number],val)<br>
				setParamNorm([name, number], val)<br>
				<br>
				getParam([name, number], ["name", "type", "val", "normval", "min","max"]) // type can return "range" or "url"<br>
				<br>
				getNumParams()<br>
				getAboutText();<br>
			</div>
		</div>
		The simplicity and consistency makes sounds models more shareable, and enables clean, readable, generalizable, and reusable code.  This slider box, for example, works with any sound that exposes the API:<br>
		<b> Choose your sound model: </b>
		<select id="soundSelector">
		</select> </br>
				<br>
		To see the API in it modest glory (controling an interactive sound in script on a web page) see <b> <a href="Demo/Demo.html">this DEMO.</a> </b>
		<br>
		<br>
		jsaSound also supports sound model developers with "composing" sound models in chains and heirarchies and (coming soon) scheduling events.
