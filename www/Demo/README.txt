A demo of how to use jsaSounds in browsers. 

First copy folders from jsaSound to your working directory:
   jsaCore/
   jsaModels/
   jsaOpCodes/

Then run.

Note that main.js uses a sound model that lives on animatedsoundworks.com 
If you want to use a local sound model, change the one argument to require to refer to a sound in jsaModels rather than to one on animatedsoundworks.com.
