		<h1><center>jsaSound for Interactive Sound on the Web</center></h1>
		<p >
			jsaSound is designed to serve two developer commumities:
			<ol>
				<li> <em>Web Developers</em> who want to use interactive audio on their web pages with a simple and consistent API, and 
				</li>
				<li> <em>Sound Model Developers</em> who want support for creating interactive sounds using the Web Audio API and want to provide a high degree of (re)usability for Web Developers. 
				</li>  
			</ol>

		<b> The Sound Model API for Web Developers: </b>
		<div id="API" >
			<div id="APItext">
				play()<br>
				release()<br>
				stop()<br>
				<br>
				setParam([name, number],val)<br>
				setParamNorm([name, number], val)<br>
				<br>
				getParam([name, number], ["name", "type", "val", "normval", "min","max"]) // type can return "range" or "url"<br>
				<br>
				getNumParams()<br>
				getAboutText();<br>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p> The simplicity and consistency makes sounds models more shareable, and enables clean, readable, generalizable, and reusable code.  
		</p>
		<p>
		To see the how simple and intuitive it is to use jsaSound models in your web pages, see <b> <a href="Demo/Demo.html">this DEMO.</a> </b><br>You might notice that the sound model for this demo is "served from the cloud" - your apps can use the sound models this way, too!

		<b> The jsaSound library for Interactive Sound Model Developers: </b>
		<br>
		</p>
		The jsaSound library also supports sound model <em><b>developers</b><em> with exposing a consistent API, hiding some of the Web Audio API complexity, the ability to "compose" sound models in chains and heirarchies (using Kumar Subramanian's very cool "GraphNode" for wrapping models to make them look like Audio Nodes), and for scheduling events in a varity of ways (see the rhythmic pattern models). <br>
