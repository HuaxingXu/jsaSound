		<h1><center>jsaSound for Interactive Sound Modeling</center></h1>
		jsaSound assists interactive sound designers in providing sound users (game, web, application developers) with models that have a simple and consistent API exposing exactly the interaction the model designer intends. <br>
		<br>
		<b> The Sound Model API: </b>
		<div id="API" >
			<div id="APItext">
				play()<br>
				release()<br>
				stop()<br>
				<br>
				setParam([name, number],val)<br>
				setParamNorm([name, number], val)<br>
				<br>
				getParam([name, number], ["name", "type", "val", "normval", "min","max"]) // type can return "range" or "url"<br>
				<br>
				getNumParams()<br>
				getAboutText();<br>
			</div>
		</div>
		The simplicity and consistency makes sounds models more shareable, and enables clean, readable, generalizable, and reusable code.  This slider box, for example, works with any sound that exposes the API:<br>
		<b> Choose your sound model: </b>
		<select id="soundSelector">
		</select> <br>
				<br>
		To see the API in its modest glory (controlling an interactive sound in script on a web page) see <b> <a href="Demo/Demo.html">this DEMO.</a> </b><br>You might notice that the sound model for this demo is "served from the cloud" - your apps can use the sound models this way, too!
		<br>
		<br>
		jsaSound also supports sound model developers with "composing" sound models in chains and heirarchies (using Kumar's very cool "GraphNode" for wrapping models to make them look like Audio Nodes), and for scheduling events in a varity of ways (see the rhythmic pattern models).
